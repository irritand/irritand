I was filling in a lot of forms for Pijnkliniek and the system did shut down at 24.00 hours. A lot of work, blood, sweat and tears lost! 
I had to start all over again!!!
So you guys, solve this problem, or at least warn all the patients that need to use these tools to fill in a really lot of questions to get to a doctor.
